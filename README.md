## mini-pixart

My **minimal/hackable** implementation of **Pixart-alpha** from the paper,
 [**PixArt-Î±: Fast Training of Diffusion Transformer for Photorealistic Text-to-Image Synthesis**
](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/). (Written in **pytorch**)

I wanted to train a small text2image model but..
trust me, the original Pixart codebase(all image gen codebases) is something else, definitely not **minimal**.
So I decided to spend time understanding and recreating it (both from paper). It's more fun to create my own version anyway **:)**

**PS:** Currently working on the training/sampling(and actually training a tiny model).
